# Python Lab 02
second batch of exercises from my lab featuring data structures, enjoy
no comment because i just wanted to finish these and go play genshin
1. Given two list. Create a third list by picking an odd-index element from
the first list and even index elements from second.

2. Given an input list removes the element at index 4 and add it to the 2nd
position and also, at the end of the list

3. Given a list slice it into a 3 equal chunks and revert each list

4. Given a list iterate it and count the occurrence of each element and create
a dictionary to show the count of each element

5. Given a two list of equal size create a set such that it shows the element
from both lists in the pair

6. Given a following two sets find the intersection and remove those elements
from the first set

7. Given two sets, Checks if One Set is Subset or superset of Another Set. if
the subset is found delete all elements from that set

8. Iterate a given list and Check if a given element already exists in a dictio-
nary as a key’s value if not delete it from the list

9. Given a dictionary get all values from the dictionary and add it in a list
but don’t add duplicates

10. Remove duplicate from a list and create a tuple and find the minimum
and maximum number

i didn't do ex 5 because i didn't understand the assignment, feel free to contact me if you have any idea
